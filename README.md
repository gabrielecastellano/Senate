## Senate: A Distributed Service Orchestration with Guarantees

Senate is a distributed architecture that enables precise orchestration of heterogeneous services over a common edge infrastructure. To assign shared resources to service orchestrators, Senate uses the Distributed Orchestration Resource Assignment (DORA), an approximation algorithm that we designed to guarantee both a bound on convergence time and an optimal (1-1/e)-approximation with respect to the Pareto optimal resource assignment.
