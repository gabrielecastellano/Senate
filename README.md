## A Distributed Service Orchestration with Guarantees

This repository provides the prototype of an architecture that enables distributed orchestration of heterogeneous applications over a common edge infrastructure. To assign shared resources to service orchestrators, we use the Distributed Orchestration Resource Assignment (DORA), an approximation algorithm that we designed to guarantee both a bound on convergence time and an optimal (1-1/e)-approximation with respect to the Pareto optimal resource assignment.
This repository also provides some proof-of-concept simulated environments to test how DORA works managing some real edge computing applications.
